                <li>In a small pot, add water and cinnamon sticks, bring to a boil and cook for
                     10 minutes. Set aside and discard cinnamon sticks.</li>
                <li>Place the rice and the cinnamon water in a large saucepan, over medium heat
                     and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add salt, butter, vanilla extract, 2 cups of milk, and sugar. Stir well to mix and 
                    cook uncovered for approximately 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium low. Add the remaining milk and condensed milk. Stir with a wooden spoon. Cook for 1 hour and 15 minutes,
                     or until the rice pudding thickens to desire consistency.</li>
                <li>Stir well and remove from heat, and let it cool at room temperature. The consistency should be very creamy. Refrigerate for
